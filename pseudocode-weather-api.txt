Goal: when search button is clicked, run function that will use information entered by user to query WeatherBit.Io API

Items needed for weather API:
1: city input ID for capturing city entered by user
2: state input ID for capturing state entered by user
3: date input for capturing time frame
4: API Key
5: Current Weather query to retrieve the weather for the city entered by the user
6: Forecast query to retrieve the forecast based on the city entered by the user


Items currently not in index.html added for this script's functionality:

1: Link to weather-api.js
**** <!-- this refers to the weather api script that will pull forecast data --> 
      <script src="weather-api.js"></script>

2: Moment.js
**** <!-- this refers to moment.min.js file -->
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.24.0/moment.min.js"></script>

3: jQuery
**** 
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"></script>

4: State input or dropdown

5: Set specific date ID (do I need this?)


Questions

1: If city and state input values are required, eliminate need for checking for value in if/then statements for functions?


To Do:

1: Change query to pull in all 16 forecasts - see if query will return values from a specific date
If not
Once response is received, will use dateInput and match it against responses in each object - loop 16 or grab length [i]
If dateInput = response.date[i]Create divs and set valueBut for testing,Â 
If dateInput is greater than dates within objectAdd note that says stay tuned for forecast?
