# Project One: "Your Best Day Out" Event Tracker
First Project for NU Coding Bootcamp

This application will assist users with planning a day out by generating options for local events and food, as well as weather conditions by date and location. Users will initiate search by choosing an event category, city/state, and date, which returns event, restaurant and weather api data based on those parameters.

# Usage

This application allows users to plan their perfect day out by aggregating a combination of event options, dining options, and weather conditions in one location, making decisions about what to do and where to go easier and more stress-free without having to query multiple sites for the same information. 

For example, if a user traveling on business wants to go out and enjoy some music for her last night in town, she can use the application to find a local show and grab a bite nearby with the knowledge that the rain won't start until the following day. At the same time, a local user entertaining family who have dropped in for the weekend can use the application to quickly find and propose an outing to the local eatery that includes a family friendly event.

A user will be able to search their event based on looking for a family friendly event or an over 21 Event (like some concerts), by a specific date, and city of their choice. When the search button is clicked, the Ticketmaster, Zomato and Weatherbit apis will display events, pull data to display restaurants close to the venue, and update weather conditions within 16 days of the current date as an additional help in planning users’ best day out.
