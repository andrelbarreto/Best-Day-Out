# Project One: "Your Best Day Out" Event Tracker
(draft) First Project for NU Coding Bootcamp

This application will assist users with planning a day out by generating options for local events and food, as well as weather conditions by date and location. Users will initiate search by choosing an event category, city/state, and date, which returns event, restaurant and weather api data based on those parameters.
